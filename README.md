# HCPD
HCPD: A New Partition Method for Power-law Graph

HCPD is a hybrid graph partitioning algorithm that is implemented into GraphLab PowerGraph (a distributed graph computation framework written in C++) and can seamlessly support all GraphLab toolkits. HCPD models the graph partition as the combinatorial design problem and guarantees that the computing load can be evenly distributed to each worker and provides high-quality partitions with a near-optimal theoretical boundary for communication cost. For more technical details, please see our paper "Optimizing Graph Partition by Optimal Vertex-Cut: A Holistic Approach"

# How to build it

The build process of HCPD is exactly the same as PowerGraph.

First, install all Dependencies (Ubuntu)

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install gcc g++ build-essential libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin default-jdk cmake zlib1g-dev git`

Compiling and Running:

`./configure`

`make -j4`


# How to run it

Powergraph is builded on mpi. So we can use mpi commands to run the graph algorithm. For PageRank:

`mpirun -np 4 ./pagerank --format=snap --graph=/your/graph/file --graph_opts ingress=matrix_block,threshold={t},etheta=2`
